# Aim-Drawer
This is a simple web based javascript application for drawing stuffs.
As per now the application is not finished yet. I have some more stuffs to add and some more functionalities.
As per now, the application can only draw shapes and texts. Will add some image functionality later. This is for a start.

## How to use
- Chose any shape you want to draw.
- After drawing the shape to your prefered shape and size and color. Click the apply button to save you changes.
-You can also add text to your drawing.
- To see your drawing as an image, chose the select tool and select the area you want to view as an image then click the download button. This will show a small image on the left panel.
- This is the image that will be downloaded once the application is finished.
- As per now, you can write click the image to save it as a file.
